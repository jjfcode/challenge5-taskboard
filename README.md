## Description

### Task Management App

#### Overview


This Task Management App is a simple yet powerful tool for organizing and tracking tasks. Built with jQuery and localStorage, it allows users to create, manage, and delete tasks with ease. The application features a drag-and-drop interface for task status updates and visual indicators for deadlines.

#### Features

- Task Creation: Easily add new tasks with a title, description, and due date.

- Dynamic Task Cards: Each task is displayed as a card that includes its title, description, and due date.

- Drag-and-Drop Functionality: Users can rearrange tasks between different status lanes (To-Do, In-Progress, Done).

- Deadline Alerts: Tasks nearing their due date are highlighted, and overdue tasks are marked distinctly.

- Local Storage: Tasks and their statuses are saved in localStorage, allowing data persistence even after refreshing the page.

#### Code Structure

- generateTaskId: Generates a unique ID for each new task.

- createTaskCard: Creates a visual representation of a task.

- renderTaskList: Renders all tasks into their respective lanes.

- handleAddTask: Manages the addition of new tasks.

- handleDeleteTask: Deletes a task from the list.
